    <p>
    Jakarta ORO's text processing classes support a wide range
    of features which are not demonstrated in this applet.
    Here we allow you to test for yourself the Perl5, AWK, and glob
    regular expression support from the org.apache.oro.text.regex,
    org.apache.oro.text.awk, and org.apache.oro.text packages.
    The Perl5 syntax demonstrated is Perl 5.003 compatible as of
    version 2.0.2.  Remember, Perl5 compatibility means that
    zero-width lookahead assertions, greed control, backreferences,
    and other features are supported.  This applet only demonstrates
    the basic functionality of the packages.  The split and substitute
    methods of the Util class and other features are not demonstrated
    here. To get a better idea of what else you can do with Jakarta
    ORO, you should  look through the <a href="api/index.html">API
    documentation</a>.

    <section name="Instructions">

    <p>
    Select a regular expression syntax in the topmost choice menu.
    Type a regular expression in the first text field.  Then in
    the <b>Search Input</b> text area, enter text that you want to
    search.  Click the <b>Search</b> button to search the input text.
    The results will appear in the <b>Search Results</b> text area.
    The <b>Reset</b> button will clear the regular expression, input,
    and result text.
    </p>
       
    <p>
    There are two choice menus that affect the regular expression
    search.  The <b>contains()</b> item causes the
    <code>contains()</code> method of the PatternMatcher interface to be
    used to perform the search.  This search is done in a while loop,
    finding all pattern matches occuring within the input.  The
    <b>matches()</b> item causes the <code>matches()</code> method of
    the PatternMatcher interface to be used to perform the search.  The
    <code>matches()</code> method only tests if all the input
    <b>EXACTLY</b> matches the regular expression.  It does not check
    to see if there is a match somewhere inside the input. That is
    what the <code>contains()</code> method is for.  This is sometimes
    a point of confusion for users who have tried other packages.  In
    Jakarta ORO, <code>matches()</code> is used to find exact matches,
    and <code>contains</code> is used to find a match contained in the
    input.
    </p>

    <p>
    The <b>Case Sensitive</b> and <b>Case Insensitive</b> choice items
    are self-explanatory.  <b>Case Sensitive</b> causes the regular
    expression to be compiled with case sensitivity enabled. <b>Case
    Insensitive</b> causes the regular expression to treat upper and
    lower case characters the same.
    </p>

    <p>
    The <b>Search Results</b> text area will display all the matches
    found in the input when the <b>contains()</b> choice item is
    selected.  It will also display what the parenthesized subgroups
    of a regular expression matched.  When the <b>matches()</b> choice
    item is selected, only whether or not the input exactly matched
    the pattern is indicated.
    </p>

    <p>
    Please note that if you don't enter anything for a regular
    expression, it will be compiled as an expression matching a
    zero-length string (the null string), which will match before and
    after every character in the input.
