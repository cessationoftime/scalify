      <p>
      The Jakarta-ORO Java classes are a set of text-processing Java
      classes that provide Perl5 compatible regular expressions,
      AWK-like regular expressions, glob expressions, and utility
      classes for performing substitutions, splits, filtering
      filenames, etc.  This library is the successor to the
      OROMatcher, AwkTools, PerlTools, and TextTools libraries
      originally from ORO, Inc.  Despite little activity in the form
      of new development initiatives, issue reports, questions, and
      suggestions are responded to quickly.
      </p>

      <p>
      You can download the latest released version from the
      <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/binindex.cgi">
      distribution</a> directory.
      </p>

      <p>
      The Javadoc is <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/oro/api/">
      available online</a>. It is also included in the distribution download.
      </p>
