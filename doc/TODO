Look at:

* http://code.google.com/p/bushel/
* https://hudson.dev.java.net/

General:

* unify icu and cu into one type and use view bounds
* projections in for-comprehensions for lazy evaluation
* revisit val => volatile var to see if it can be avoided
* find deterministic strategy for renaming and id generation so diffs are meaningful
* end schizophrenia regarding dom.* types and our wrapper types, especially in pattern matching contexts
