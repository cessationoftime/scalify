* https://hudson.dev.java.net/
* git://github.com/hseeberger/scalamodules.git 

General:

* Logging trait: abstract "isDebug" method which can be implemented elsewhere
* unify icu and cu into one type and use view bounds
* projections in for-comprehensions for lazy evaluation
* revisit val => volatile var to see if it can be avoided
* find deterministic strategy for renaming and id generation so diffs are meaningful
* end schizophrenia regarding dom.* types and our wrapper types, especially in pattern matching contexts
* for flow control exceptions, extend throwable and override fillInStackTrace with noop
